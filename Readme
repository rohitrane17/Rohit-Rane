Main task been completed and tested
Bonus task one is not completed as I was not able to ignore the cities in All tab, I tried to collect the data but as they are not dependend on selection of country I found it hard to categorize.
Bonus task  two is not completed as the shortlist button was giving no such element error, i tried with different techniquies but  the result was till the same.
TestData layer currently it is blank but we can store data to run multiple test validation and input
UtilsLayer consists of all the methods which are required to perform testing
In testlayer it consist of the validation test needed to perfom
If possible can you please provide the method to ignore the all tab & finding duplication in cities & also to shortlist the room
